# RAG-App Evaluator

## Overview
The **RAG-App Evaluator** is a tool designed for evaluating and analyzing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It provides an interface to test RAG systems, analyze their performance, and identify areas for improvement. The tool is built with Python and includes several utilities for working with data and models in the RAG pipeline.

## Features
- **Evaluation Framework**: Assess the performance of RAG applications.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Tools for inspecting and processing datasets used in the RAG pipeline.
- **Customizable Metrics**: Define and evaluate custom metrics based on your application requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for interacting with the tool.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package manager)
